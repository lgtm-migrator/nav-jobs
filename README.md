# NAV home assignment

We want you to create a simple app / website that retrieves job advertisements from NAV's REST API and shows them to the user. 

The ads are downloaded from NAV's website <https://arbeidsplassen.nav.no/>

## Features

- React with Typescript
- Typography and colors used by NAV

## Requirements

The app must meet these criteria:

-   The user should be able to see the last 10 ads when the app is opened

-   Each ad should show:

    dato (published)
    job title (jobtitle)
    ad title

-   The user should be able to press a button to see the next 10 ads

-   Each ad should have an "Open" button that allows the ad to show:

    job description (description)
    employer
    degree of extent (extent)
    applicationDue.

-   Each ad should have a "Save" button. Saved ads must be presented in a separate field.

-   Saved ads should not disappear even if the browser is closed and reopened.
